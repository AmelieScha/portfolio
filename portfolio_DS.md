# Data Science Portfolio
I have six years of experience with data analysis, computational modeling, and machine learning in Python. I am proficient in using Python to perform statistical analyses, data visualization, predictive modeling, and bioinformatic analyses. In my job as a Bioinformatic Data Scientist, I also became very familiar with using R to implement various bioinformatic workflows and analyses.
